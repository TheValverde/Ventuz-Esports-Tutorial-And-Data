# eSports LED Graphics Template Project

This project aims to provide professional-quality templates for eSports LED graphics using Ventuz. The templates are designed to enhance the visual experience during eSports events and broadcasts.

## Introduction

This repository contains a collection of Ventuz scenes that serve as templates for creating visually stunning and dynamic eSports LED graphics. The scenes are designed to be educational resources for users to learn how to set up and configure these templates for professional-quality output.

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Open Ventuz and create a new project.
3. Import the desired Ventuz scenes from the repository into your project.
4. Go through the scenes one by one to explore their structure and functionality.
5. Study the node networks, shaders, and animations within each scene to understand the techniques used to achieve the desired visual effects.
6. Modify and customize the scenes according to your specific requirements.
7. Experiment with different data sources, input configurations, and styling options to create unique and personalized eSports LED graphics.
8. Export the finalized scenes as Ventuz packages for your personal use or non-commercial purposes only.
